## Bayesian Statistics (bachelor level)

In the second year of the Radboud University AI bachelor program. This course is also highly interesting for PhD students in neuroscience or psychology that want to start with computational modelling. More information can be found in the [Radboud University study guide](https://www.ru.nl/en/education/bachelors/artificial-intelligence/study-programme-artificial-intelligence/study-programme-bachelor-artificial-intelligence-year-2).

## Bayesian Machine Learning (master level)

In the Radboud University AI master program we crank up the Bayesness and offer a course on Bayesian methods for machine learning. We focus in particular on Gaussian processes and Bayesian neural networks.
